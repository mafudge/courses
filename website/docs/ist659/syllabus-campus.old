### Required Textbooks and Supplies

-   **Applied Database Management**, By Michael Fudge.
    ISBN 9781644965900. The book is an online text available within
    Blackboard, and at https://www.grlcontent.com/. At your instructor's discretion you may take quizzes through the textbook. The textbook is very closely aligned with the course content and and labs.

-   Students are expected to have a laptop computer to participate in
    the class sessions, run the lab software, and complete the problem
    sets. Requirements are any Mac OSX, Windows 10, or Chromebook with
    8GB RAM and 8GB free disk space.

### Understanding the Approach Used in This Course

To instill good habits and routine, the approach used in this course is
the same each week. It is designed to allow you to progress as a
learner, ask questions, and grow comfortable with the material
throughout the week. There are three phases to the approach:

-   **Coursework Before Class** consists of a chapter reading from the
    textbook and a video lecture. Both are active learning tools, and
    you will be asked questions as you read and watch. Your responses
    are not graded but will be reviewed by your instructor to prepare
    for the in-class session. As part of your engagement with the
    learning process, it is expected you will review your own answers
    and prepare any questions or doubts you have about the coursework.
    You will also be issued a quiz that reinforces basic concepts from
    the textbook and asynchronous content .Your learning outcomes at
    this stage are to recall key terms and understand the concepts
    presented to you.

-   The **In-Class session** allows you to reinforce what you have
    learned and to begin to apply it to new problems and situations. We
    begin each class with students posting their coursework questions to
    the community board. Your questions should be based on concepts that
    remain unclear to you. These questions will guide out class
    discussions and activities. We then review the previous week' s
    homework / problem sets, discussing strategies and sharing answers
    to them.

-   **After Class** you will complete a lab and problem set. The lab
    contains a walk-through to guide you through the application of the
    problem-solving approaches relevant to this week's material. The
    problem set is your opportunity to self-measure your knowledge of
    the material and application of it to new situations and scenarios.
    Included with your problem set is a metacognitive activity where you
    are asked to reflection upon your experiences as a learner that week
    and asses your comfort level with the material.

### Tools we may use in this Course

It is suggested that you install and configure these tools on your
laptop before the course begins.

-   **Zoom.** Zoom is a video conferencing tool we will use for our
    scheduled online and hybrid face to face sessions. Each session will
    be recorded and posted to Blackboard. Download the zoom client at
    <https://zoom.us>

-   **Microsoft Teams.** Teams is collaboration tool. Integrating with
    email and calendaring Teams offers presence awareness and chat /
    messaging. These chats can be elevated into a video conference. We
    will use teams for class discussions, homework questions and office
    hours. You are welcome to contact me whenever my status says I am
    available. Your Office 365 account is linked to your NetID. Logon to
    teams by visiting <https://portal.office.com> entering your SU email
    *<netid@syr.edu>* and then your NetID password. One you are signed
    into Office 365, click the Teams icon.

-   **Google Docs**. We will use Google Docs as a collaborative
    note-taking tool to work in class on problems and breakout
    activities. Login with your SU Google account <https://g.syr.edu>.

-   **Docker**. Docker is a containerization platform, allowing you to
    run applications in isolation from your host computer. In this
    course we use it to run the DBMS itself and their supporting tools.
    You can download and install docker by following the instructions
    here: <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>

-   **Azure Data Studio**. Azure Data studio (ADS) is a SQL Database
    client. While you can get away with using the web tools provided
    with the learn-databases setup, the ADS experience is better. To
    install, follow the instructions here:
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio>

-   **Learn Databases.** Learn Databases is a suite of docker containers
    which create a database lab environment on your computer. There are
    containers for the SQL Server database management system itself, and
    3 web tools for provisioning sample databases, database
    administration and writing SQL scripts. After you have installed
    Docker, follow the instructions at
    <https://github.com/mafudge/learn-databases#walkthrough> to set it
    up. Do not create any sample databases at this time -- you will do
    this as part of the first problem set.

### Special Considerations

1.  **Complete asynchronous coursework.** It is expected you will
    complete the assigned readings, quizzes and video coursework as
    prescribed.
    -   Participation in the assigned reading and video coursework is
        required and will be measured through analytics tools provided
        by the LMS and the textbook.  
    -   Attendance is required and there are no excused absences other
        than medical illness documented by the university. You must be
        present to participate!  
    -   While in attendance you are expected to be engaged, an active
        participant in class. You should be prepared to ask and answer
        questions to the best of your ability when called upon.  
    -   In some classes an ungraded pop-quiz or other type of diagnostic
        instrument will measure your comprehension of coursework and
        passing will count as your participation grade for that week.  
    -   Reading and Video lectures must be completed by 11:59 PM Eastern
        time 1 day before our class meeting.  
    -   **Reading, participation and coursework are not graded but do
        impact your grade.**  
        -   **Unprepared for 2 units of the course: decrease your final
            grade by one Registrar Grade. (For example, A to A-)**  
        -   **For 4 or more units of the course: decrease your final
            grade one complete letter: B+ to C+ for example.**  
        -   **You will be notified when you reach these thresholds.**  

2.  **Complete Quizzes**. The intention of the quiz is to ensure you are
    keeping pace with the coursework and to measure your understanding
    of the class material. At your instructor's discretion, quizzes are issued through the online textbook out of class, or through some other means in class.

    -   You will get one attempt at the quiz and your attempt must be
        complete before your class meeting. 
    -   Quizzes consist of multiple choice and/or short answer
        questions.  
    -   Quizzes individual effort.  
    -   You must complete the quiz on its due date and there are no make
        ups.  

3.  **Complete Homework Problem Sets**. These problem sets are technical
    activities which enforce key concepts learned in the lesson through
    problem-solving and practice. You start them after our class session
    and complete them by 11:59 PM Eastern the day before our next class.
    It is important to remember that the homework is practice, if you do
    not have the right correct, it is expected you will have questions.
    You are expected to reflect on your learning. Each Problem Set is
    assigned a grade of:

    -   High Pass (10 points) the assignment is complete and correct
        with very minor errors, and student contributes to homework
        discussion in class and a reflection on your learning for that
        week.
