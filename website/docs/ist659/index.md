## Pedagogical Philosophy

The course uses flipped instruction, a.k.a "the Unlecture". Students will watch lecture videos and read the textbook before class. In class, students will work go over the homewor, discuss lecture content and work on exercises designed around the content. The instructor will be available to answer questions and provide guidance.

## Course Materials

The course is well designed and has a wealth of course materials. In addition, the content is very tightly coupled â€“ the labs, text, videos, homework all go together.  For example, the SQL you see written in the lecture video or textbook can be run in the same lab environment the students use. Students have access to the databases used and the code that was written. This provides a superior student experience as much of the learning translates from activity to activity.

The rest of the content can be found in the course, whether on-campus or on-line. 


## Lab Environment

The lab environment requires the student to install Docker desktop and then clone this GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mafudge/learn-databases](https://github.com/mafudge/learn-databases)

If the instructor does not wish to support the installation of Docker desktop on the student's computer, they can use the [University's Azure Labs Service](https://answers.syr.edu/display/ischool/Azure+Lab+Services+-+iSchool).
