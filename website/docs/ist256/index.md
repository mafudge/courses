IST256: Application Programming for Information Systems

## Course Overview

This course is an undergraduate introduction to computer programming from the information sciences perspective. Currently students learn the fundamental of programming in Python with some emphasis on data analytics. The course is for absolute beginners and takes the perspective that students should learn to read use and evaluate other people's code. 

### Frequency 

The course is taught every semester with several sections offered.

### Audience

Undergraduates new to programming but have an interest in learning it. The course is appropriate for both majors and non-majors.

## Syllabus

The course is taught on campus.

## Pedagogical Philosophy

The pedagogical philosophy of this course is targeted at the course audience - students new to computer programming. It uses science-based learning principles such as spaced repetition, reflective learning, and building habits through routine practice. The course is designed to be a "learning by doing" course. Students are expected to spend a significant amount of time outside of class learning through assignments. In-class time is spent on learning reinforcement through discussion and practice.

## Course Materials

Course materials are made available on the https://ist256.com course website [https://ist256.com/content/](https://ist256.com/content/). These include:

- Assigned readings and videos to watch before class
- Recorded lectures (posted after class)
- Lab walk-through videos to help students to complete the lab and answer common questions
- Homework advice to assist with starting the homework
- Additional resources for learning on your own

## Lab Environment

The current lab environment uses a JupyterHub cluster [https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The cluster is hosted on the Syracuse University academic virtual hosting environment (AVHE) on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. The cluster allows several hundred students to work on their programming assignments at the same time.

IST256 students have a custom-built image for the course. This image has Python and common packages used in the course pre-installed. Students are given administrative accesss to their running image. This means that they can install additional packages as needed.

The Hub is configured so that when students login, a Github repository is cloned for them, for example: [https://github.com/IST256/learn-python](https://github.com/IST256/learn-python). This repository contains the lecture materials, sample code, assignments, and supporting utilities. 

There is no need for students to upload or download materials to Blackboard for grading or fetching assignments. There are tools integrated into the Hub so that students can turn in their work and it can be graded by the instructor right on the cluster. 

The Jupyterhub cluster url is [https://hub.ischool.syr.edu](https://hub.ischool.syr.edu). Students can login using their SU NetID and password.
