### Required Textbooks and Supplies

-   **Applied Database Management**, By Michael Fudge.
    ISBN 9781644965900. The book is an online text available within
    Blackboard, and at https://www.grlcontent.com/. At your instructor's discretion you may take quizzes through the textbook. The textbook is very closely aligned with the course content and and labs.

-   Students are expected to have a laptop computer to participate in
    the class sessions, run the lab software, and complete the problem
    sets. Requirements are any Mac OSX, Windows 10, or Chromebook with
    8GB RAM and 8GB free disk space.

    NOTE: In Lieu of installing the software on your laptop, your instructor may opt to use the cloud-based Azure Lab Services. 

### Understanding the Approach Used in This Course

To instill good habits and routine, the approach used in this course is
the same each week. It is designed to allow you to progress as a
learner, ask questions, and grow comfortable with the material
throughout the week. There are three phases to the approach:

-   **Coursework before class** consists of a chapter reading from the
    textbook and a video lecture. Both are active learning tools, and
    you will be asked questions as you read and watch. Your responses
    are not graded but will be reviewed by your instructor to prepare
    for the in-class session. As part of your engagement with the
    learning process, it is expected that you will review your own
    answers and prepare any questions or doubts you have about the
    coursework. You will also be issued a quiz that reinforces basic
    concepts from the textbook and asynchronous content. Your learning
    outcomes at this stage are to recall key terms and understand the
    concepts presented to you.

-   The **live session** allows you to reinforce what you have learned
    and to begin to apply it to new problems and situations. We begin
    each class with students posting their coursework questions to the
    community board. Your questions should be based on concepts that
    remain unclear to you. These questions will guide our class
    discussions and activities. We then review the previous week's
    homework problem set, discussing strategies, and sharing answers to
    them.

-   **After class** you will complete a lab and Homework Problem Set.
    The lab contains a walk-through to guide you through the application
    of the problem-solving approaches relevant to this week's material.
    The Homework Problem Set is your opportunity to self-measure your
    knowledge of the material and application of it to new situations
    and scenarios. Included with your Homework Problem Set is a
    metacognitive activity where you are asked to reflect on your
    experiences as a learner that week and asses your comfort level with
    the material.

### Tools We May Use in This Course

It is suggested that you install and configure these tools on your
laptop before the course begins.

-   **Zoom.** Zoom is a video conferencing tool we will use for our
    scheduled online and hybrid face-to-face sessions. Download the Zoom
    client at <https://zoom.us>

-   **Microsoft Teams.** Teams is collaboration tool. Integrating with
    email and calendar, Teams offers presence awareness and
    chat/messaging. These chats can be elevated into a video conference.
    We will use teams for class discussions, homework questions, and
    office hours. You are welcome to contact me whenever my status says
    I am available. Your Office 365 account is linked to your NetID. Log
    on to teams by visiting <https://portal.office.com>, entering your
    SU email <netid@syr.edu> and then your NetID password. One you are
    signed into Office 365, click the Teams icon.

-   **Google Docs**. We will use Google Docs as a collaborative
    note-taking tool to work in class on problems and breakout
    activities. Log in with your SU Google account: <https://g.syr.edu>.

-   **Docker**. Docker is a containerization platform, allowing you to
    run applications in isolation from your host computer. In this
    course, we use it to run the DBMS itself and supporting tools. You
    can download and install Docker by following the instructions here:
    <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>

-   **Azure Data Studio**. Azure Data Studio (ADS) is a SQL database
    client. While you can get away with using the web tools provided
    with the Learn Databases setup, the ADS experience is better. To
    install, follow the instructions here:
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio>

-   **Learn Databases.** Learn Databases is a suite of Docker containers
    that create a database lab environment on your computer. There are
    containers for the SQL Server database management system itself and
    three web tools for provisioning sample databases, database
    administration, and writing SQL scripts. After you have installed
    Docker, follow the instructions at
    <https://github.com/mafudge/learn-databases#walkthrough> to set it
    up. Do not create any sample databases at this time---you will do
    this as part of the first Homework Problem Set.

## Special Considerations

### Class Materials and Recordings

Please be aware that all class sessions will be recorded. Original class
materials (handouts, code samples, assignments, quizzes, textbook
chapters, etc.) and recordings of class sessions are the intellectual
property of the course instructor. You may download these materials for
your use in this class. However, you may not provide these materials to
other parties (e.g., websites, social media, other students) without
permission. Doing so is a violation of intellectual property law and of
the student code of conduct.

## Academic Expectations

### Requirements

As an enrolled student in this course, it is expected that you will:

1.  **Complete asynchronous coursework.** It is expected you will
    complete the assigned textbook readings, quizzes, and video
    coursework as prescribed.

    -   Participation in the assigned reading and video coursework is
        required and will be measured.  
    -   Attendance in online or face-to-face sessions is required, and
        there are no excused absences other than medical illness
        documented by the university.  
    -   While in attendance, you are expected to be engaged, an active
        participant in class. You should be prepared to ask and answer
        questions to the best of your ability when called upon.  
    -   It is expected that you will have your microphone muted until
        you need to speak, and your video camera on at all times.  
    -   In some classes, an ungraded pop quiz or other type of
        diagnostic instrument will measure your comprehension of
        coursework and passing will count as your participation grade
        for that week.  
    -   **Reading, participation, and coursework are not graded but do
        impact your grade.**  
        -   **unprepared for 2 units of the course: decrease your final
            grade by one Registrar Grade. (For example, A to A-) **   
        -   **For 4 or more units of the course: decrease your final
            grade one complete letter: B+ to C+ for example.**    
        -   **You will be notified when you reach these thresholds.**   

2.  **Complete quizzes**. The intention of the quiz is to ensure that
    you are keeping pace with the coursework and to measure your
    understanding of the class material. Quizzes should be completed by
    11:59 PM Eastern the day before our live session. 
    -   Quizzes are delivered through the online LMS. 
    -   You will get one attempt at the quiz, and your attempt must be
        complete before your class meeting.  
    -   Quizzes are open book.  
    -   Quizzes consist of multiple-choice and/or short answer
        questions.  
    -   Quizzes measure only individual effort.  
    -   You must complete the quiz on your own time, outside class. 
    -   Quizzes are due 11:59 PM Eastern the day before our live
        session. This provides your instructor ample time to review
        student answers and prepare for the live session.  

3.  **Complete** **homework problem sets**. Homework Problem Sets are
    technical activities that enforce key concepts learned in the lesson
    through problem solving and practice. You start them after the live
    session and complete them by the 11:59 PM Eastern the day before our
    next live session. It is important to remember that the homework is
    practice; if you do not have the right answers, it is expected you
    will have questions. Save those questions for our discussions. You
    are expected to reflect on your learning. Each homework problem set
    is assigned a grade of:

    -   High Pass (10 points)---the assignment is complete and correct,
        with very minor errors, and the student contributes to homework
        discussion in class and reflects on your learning for that week.  
    -   Pass (7 points)---the assignment is complete and mostly correct,
        or the student has few to no contributions to homework
        discussions in class or little to no reflection on your learning
        for the week.  
    -   Needs Improvement (3 points)---the assignment is incomplete or
        has several errors or is late, with no reflection.  
    -   Fail (0 points)---the assignment was not turned in after 1 week.  

4.  **Complete a** **team project**, which demonstrates your ability to
    work in a team to design and implement a functional system with a
    database, based on what you have learned in the course. Guidelines
    for this are:
    -   Work in self-assembled teams of two to three students.  
    -   Devise your own database to design and implement. The project
        idea must be preapproved, prior to beginning work.  

Required artifacts for team project submission are as follows:

1.  Document with team name, group members, and which project you will
    work on. If the project is your own idea, a requirements document
    must be submitted and approved.  
2.  Data analysis of the facts listing entities, attributes, and
    relationships in the data model.  
3.  Conceptual data model diagram.  
4.  Logical data model diagram.  
5.  Identification of your external data model and data logic.  
6.  Basic layout of all application screens.  
7.  Diagram of each screen used in the application.  
8.  SQL up/down script to implement the internal model with initial
    data.  
9.  SQL up/down Script to load/migrate in existing data.  
10. SQL up/down script of data logic for the external data model.  
11. Implementation of the application itself.  
12. A team log recording individual and group contributions to the
    project, including when and by whom.  
13. A slide deck of your presentation.  
14. A video recording of your team presentation.  
15. A video reflection of what you learned from the experience, what you
    would do better if you had the time, etc.  

The rubric is as follows:

1.  Quality of artifacts (slides, code, video, documents, etc.)  
2.  Completeness of project---does it work?  
3.  Purpose of project---does it do something of value?  
4.  What was learned from the experience?  
5.  Does the project demonstrate what the team has learned pertinent to
    the course?

    ask.  

### Academic Integrity

-   We take academic integrity seriously, and so should you.  
-   It is our expectation that your work will be 100% representative of
    your academic abilities.  
-   Cheating, including assistance from others or use of non-sanctioned
    academic materials on quizzes or homework is prohibited.  
-   Do not work together unless the instructions state explicitly you
    are permitted to do so.  
-   When in doubt as to whether you can use a resource outside those
    provided in the course, **ask your instructor**.  
-   All violations of academic integrity will be reported to the AIO
    office. Proposed grade sanction is F in the course.
