It uses science-based learning principles such as spaced repetition, reflective learning, and building habits through routine practice. The course is designed to be a \"learning by doing\" course. Students are expected to spend a significant amount of time outside of class learning through assignments. In-class time is spent on learning reinforcement through discussion and practice.</p> <p>https://ist256.com/syllabus/#understanding-approach-used-in-this-course</p>"},{"location":"ist256/#course-materials","title":"Course Materials","text":"<p>Course materials are made available on the https://ist256.com course website https://ist256.com/content/.

The cluster is hosted on the Syracuse University academic virtual hosting environment (AVHE) on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. The cluster allows several hundred students to work on their programming assignments at the same time.</p> <p>IST256 students have a custom-built image for the course. This image has Python and common packages used in the course pre-installed. Students are given administrative accesss to their running image. This means that they can install additional packages as needed.</p> <p>The Hub is configured so that when students login, a Github repository is cloned for them, for example: https://github.com/IST256/learn-python. This repository contains the lecture materials, sample code, assignments, and supporting utilities. </p> <p>There is no need for students to upload or download materials to Blackboard for grading or fetching assignments. There are tools integrated into the Hub so that students can turn in their work and it can be graded by the instructor right on the cluster. </p> <p>The Jupyterhub cluster url is https://hub.ischool.syr.edu. Students can login using their SU NetID and password.</p>"},{"location":"ist256/#instructor-resources","title":"Instructor Resources","text":"<ul> <li>Teacher tools available to make grading student work easier and more efficient</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ist769/","title":"About IST769","text":"<p>This is a page for IST769</p>"},{"location":"ist769/#syllabi","title":"Syllabi","text":"<ul> <li>Campus Syllabus<ul> <li>docx</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"ist769/syllabus/","title":"IST769 Syllabus","text":""},{"location":"ist769/syllabus/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>dsjkhafgaksdfjhfkljasdh fkjadshf sadjhghf kasjdhfjkl ashdlkfjhas</p>"},{"location":"ist769/syllabus/#something","title":"Something","text":"<p>sadjhfgaksjdhgf kasjdhgf kjshdgf</p>"},{"location":"ist769/syllabus/#evaluatyion","title":"Evaluatyion","text":"<p>sadjhkgf asdkjhfg kjsdhg fkjahsgd fkjh gsd kfjhga sdkjhfg aksjdhfg kjahsd</p>"}]}
