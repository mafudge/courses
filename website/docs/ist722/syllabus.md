### Course Description

Introduction to concepts of business intelligence (BI) and the practice/techniques in building a BI solution. Focuses are on how to use data warehouses as a BI solution to make better organizational decisions.

### Additional Course Description

This course provides concepts, principles, and tools for designing, implementing, and using Data Warehouses. More specifically, we introduce database constructs such as Operational Data Store (ODS), Data Warehouse, and Data Mart, as well as their components. We study the differences between Ralf Kimball’s and Bill Inmon's approaches, roles and responsibilities in the design and implementation of a Data Warehouse, project management guidelines and techniques, requirements gathering, dimensional modeling, Extract Transform and Load (ETL) architecture, specification and data loading, master and reference data management, integration approaches (ETL, EII, EAI), analytical reporting concepts, data governance and recent trends in the data warehouse domain. 

The course will leverage a portfolio of SQL Server tools that include SQL Server DBMS, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and SQL Server Analysis Service (SSAS) to provide hands-on experience in implementing a reporting solution through assignments, lab exercises and projects. 

Definition, development, and management of databases for information systems. Data analysis techniques, data modeling, and schema design. Query languages and search specifications. Overview of file organization for databases. Data administration concepts and skills.


### Prerequisite / Co-requisite: 

IST659 Data Administration Concepts and Database Management

## Academic Expectations

### Requirements

As an enrolled student in this course, it is expected that you will:

1.  **Complete asynchronous coursework.** It is expected you will
    complete the assigned readings, quizzes and video coursework as
    prescribed.
    -   Participation in the assigned reading and video coursework is
        required and will be measured through analytics tools provided
        by the LMS and the textbook.  
    -   Attendance is required and there are no excused absences other
        than medical illness documented by the university. You must be
        present to participate!  
    -   While in attendance you are expected to be engaged, an active
        participant in class. You should be prepared to ask and answer
        questions to the best of your ability when called upon.  
    -   In some classes an ungraded pop-quiz or other type of diagnostic
        instrument will measure your comprehension of coursework and
        passing will count as your participation grade for that week.  
    -   Reading and Video lectures must be completed by 11:59 PM Eastern
        time 1 day before our class meeting.  
    -   **Reading, participation and coursework are not graded but do
        impact your grade.**  
        -   **Unprepared for 2 units of the course: decrease your final
            grade by one Registrar Grade. (For example, A to A-)**  
        -   **For 4 or more units of the course: decrease your final
            grade one complete letter: B+ to C+ for example.**  
        -   **You will be notified when you reach these thresholds.**  

2.  **Complete Quizzes**. The intention of the quiz is to ensure you are
    keeping pace with the coursework and to measure your understanding
    of the class material. At your instructor's discretion, quizzes are issued through the online textbook out of class, or through some other means in class.

    -   You will get one attempt at the quiz and your attempt must be
        complete before your class meeting. 
    -   Quizzes consist of multiple choice and/or short answer
        questions.  
    -   Quizzes individual effort.  
    -   You must complete the quiz on its due date and there are no make
        ups.  

3.  **Complete Homework Problem Sets**. These problem sets are technical
    activities which enforce key concepts learned in the lesson through
    problem-solving and practice. You start them after our class session
    and complete them by 11:59 PM Eastern the day before our next class.
    It is important to remember that the homework is practice, if you do
    not have the right correct, it is expected you will have questions.
    You are expected to reflect on your learning. Each Problem Set is
    assigned a grade of:

    -   High Pass (10 points) the assignment is complete and correct
        with very minor errors, and student contributes to homework
        discussion in class and a reflection on your learning for that
        week.  
    -   Pass (7 points) the assignment is complete and mostly correct,
        or student has little to no contributions to homework
        discussions in class, or little to no reflection on your
        learning for the week.  
    -   Needs Improvement (3 point) the assignment is incomplete or has
        several errors or is late, no reflection.  
    -   Fail (0 points) the assignment was not turned in after 1 week.

4.  Complete a **Team Project**, which demonstrates your ability to work
    in a team to design and implement a functional system with a
    database, based on what you have learned in the course. Guidelines:

    -   Work in self-assembled teams of 2-3 students.  
    -   Devise your own database to design and implement. The project
        idea must be pre-approved prior to beginning work.
