Unlike its Computer Science equivalent, we try to make this course as applied as possible through the lens of the Information field. Yes, every student who passes this course should know Python, but more importantly we are teaching them how to become problem-solvers, troubleshooters, and computational thinkers, while exposing them to typical computational tasks in the Information field like text processing, data analysis, visualization, and API consumption. We also want our students to understand how to communicate with code (read it, write it, and explain it) as well as use the tools programmers use (Notebooks, the command line, and Git).</p>"},{"location":"ist256/teaching/#course-approach","title":"Course Approach","text":"<p>The approach I take in this course is the culmination of 20+ years of personal successes and failures with teaching students to program in Assembler, C, Basic, SQL, Java and Python. It's still not perfect and probably never will be. What I have discovered over all this time: students achieve success through repetition and practice. It is import for us to assign timely feedback for their work, so students can engage in the learning process. </p> <p>For any given unit across a week of time, here is the general pattern:</p> <ol> <li>First students read the chapter independently. The goal here is to expose them to the concepts and to begin to make connections with why they are important. Get your students in the habit of writing down questions about which they don\u2019t understand so they can ask in large group.</li> <li>In large group we reinforce the concepts from the reading through examples. Students are allowed to ask questions. I provide code demos which I run and explain and share with the students so they can run them for themselves after class. At this point there is no student programming, and I ask students to not try to type along as I type as often students who do tend to get behind. </li> <li>After large group, students complete a lab which is due the day before their small group. The goal to provide students with a means to get their hands on the keyboard and actually try coding for the first time. The labs are generally walk-throughs, and the coding is mostly trivial, and should be fairly straight forward for most, provided the student has been putting in some effort. For those who struggle, there is a lab walkthrough video they can watch that explains how to complete the lab. </li> <li>Before your small group, you want to review your student lab submissions. Focus on completeness, correctness, comfort level, and questions. The lab grader tool should help you do this quickly. Since students can watch the lab walkthrough videos, you should expect labs to be 100% correct and all cells to be executed. Use the comfort level and questions to prepare for small group. Students with poor metacognition or a lack of questions should not get full credit on the lab assignment.</li> <li>In your small group you will quickly review the lab and then get into a homework assignment that the entire class does together. This allows students to apply coding concepts in a group environment where they are led by you and their classmates. There are many ways you can solicit engagement here, and in time you will discover what works best for your teaching style as well as your students. I highly discourage you from allocating full credit to students who are not in attendance. Attendance and participation must be encouraged. </li> <li>After small group students are assigned an individual homework assignment. This demonstrates a student\u2019s ability to problem solve and write code independently. The solutions are relatively small 10-40 lines of Python code, but most students will not be able to complete them in a single sitting (despite wanting to do so). They will struggle with how to approach the problem, often skipping that step and heading right for code. It is important to encourage them to think through the problem before diving into the weeds with coding. There is a video students can watch that explains how to approach the homework. It does not show how to complete it, but only offers advice on how to approach the problem.</li> <li>You conclude your week by reviewing and grading your students homework submissions. <ul> <li>You should evaluate it through the lens of this question: How well did this student demonstrate they can problem solve and write code independently? </li> <li>Expect students to work alone on the homework. If they get help from someone or something, it should be disclosed in their reflection or code, just like how a paper might include citations. If they use the PyBot GPT3 AI assistant, expect the %%pybot cell to be present along with the AI\u2019s output. </li> <li>Expect a decent problem analysis. The inputs and outputs should be easily identified. The algorithm should articulate the plan, step by step, in a natural language. Students who write python algorithms or copy their solution as an algorithm should not get credit here.</li> <li>The student\u2019s reflection should focus on what they learned through completing the homework. It is the case for most students that they will have picked up some new things or had previous concepts become concretized by way of completing the homework. You should see this in their reflection.  </li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"ist256/teaching/#tips-for-success","title":"Tips for Success","text":"<ul> <li>For many students this will be their first college level course in programming. In addition, the vast majority of students will not pursue a career in programming. Recognize this and be supportive of it. It is our job to help them find the value in what they will learn in the course.</li> <li>Condition your students to respect the due dates. Timeliness from routine practice is important to student success and students who fall behind almost never catch up. </li> <li>Homework and Labs are practice activities. They should be treated and graded as such. Expect your students to not get it right, and require that they articulate their specific  shortcomings and aspects of the problem they do not understand. Do not accept \u201cI am lost\u201d as an answer, demand specifics. Place considerable emphasis on the reflective activities.</li> <li>Considering homework is practice, encourage students to review their materials, the large group lecture, the code samples, and the small group activities as preparation for completing the homework. Remind them the answers are there somewhere in the unit.</li> <li>Remind your students of the purpose of  the project  and the exams are summative assessments. They measure what the student has learned. The Small Group, Lab and Homework are formative assessments.</li> <li>Students are expected to reflect on their work and perform a self-assessment of their understanding of the work they attempt. You will factor this into their work, for example an incorrect submission without detailed rationale will not receive full credit. Even a correct submission shouldn't. We want to encourage them to make mistakes, learn from them, and understand the importance of developing good metacognitive skills through reflection. There is research supporting this idea, here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08993408.2012.655091 . </li> <li>There is a prevailing movement out there among CS academics, which I support, that grading homework  based on getting it right only encourages students to cheat, and even encourages the grader to look for cheaters. https://computinged.wordpress.com/2020/07/30/proposal-3-to-change-cs-education-to-reduce-inequity-call-a-truce-on-academic-misconduct-cases-on-programming-assignments/ .</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ist256/teaching/#lesson-plan-for-a-typical-small-group","title":"Lesson Plan for a Typical Small Group","text":"<p>INSTRUCTOR PREP: Grade the lab and use the lab grading tool to help you revisit common misconceptions and student questions.

I am a big believer in the science behind distributed practice. Simply put, you will be more effective learner if you are exposed to the subject matter several times over the week, rather than just one per week. As such, each lesson has three phases, which I recommend you distribute over 4 days each week:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Before Class: Coursework phase. Before our class meeting, you are expected to:     a.  read the assigned textbook chapter and complete the active         learning activities,     b.  watch the video lecture and complete the active learning         activities therein, and     c.  as you consume the lesson, prepare questions or demonstrations         you would like to see pertinent to the course material,     d.  complete a textbook chapter quiz</p> <p>For best results, try to spread these activities over at least two different days. For instance, you might read on</p> </li> <li> <p>In-Class. Learning Reinforcement. During our three-hour class     session, we will engage in activities that reinforce of what you     have learned and provide feedback for activities completed outside     of class. We will:     a.  Answer your posted questions based on the course material. There         is an expectation you will come to class with questions and         doubts about the course material. These will be addressed and         discussed in the in-class session.     b.  Go over the textbook and lecture questions frequently missed by         the students offering reinforcement of the concepts as required,         1     c.  Review the quiz answers and discuss problematic questions,     d.  Go over the previous unit's lab problem set. Students will be         expected to post and discuss their solutions, and     e.  Time-permitting, participate in class activities which         demonstrate your ability to apply the course material  </p> </li> <li> <p>After Class. Demonstrate what you can apply. Lab and Problem Set. After class, you are expected to complete:     a.  a lab: a guided activity based on the week's coursework, and     b.  a problem set: homework problems where you must problem solve         and develop solutions to problems related to the week's         coursework.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>This system is very effective and once you get used to it, I am certain you will discover it is a productive use of your time.</p>"},{"location":"ist659/teaching/#tools-used-in-this-course","title":"Tools Used In This Course","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Learn-Databases.
